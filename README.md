# Academic_Helper
## This is a website I created for an academic Helper Application. This embeds a YouTube API that searches for videos on your course topic and provides the link directly to your webpage.
## The technologies used here were Flask, HTML, and CSS. This is also a template you can use for your webpage. I have done the hard work of adding the API so you can add your functionality, like profiles, email notifications, and the rest.
## Make sure you download flask and necessary libraries to be able to run it.
