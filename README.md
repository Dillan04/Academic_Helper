# Academic_Helper
## This is a website I created for an academic Helper Application. This embedds a youtube API that searches for videos on your course topic and provides the link directlyto your webpage.
## The technologies used here were Flask, HTML and CSS. This is also a template you can use for your own webpage. I have done the hard work of adding the API so you can add your own functionality like profiles, email notifications, and the rest.
## Make sure you download flaska dn necessary libraries to be able to run it.
